Human-aware epistemic planning for promoting behavior-change.

### Abstract

This paper introduces an approach to human-aware epistemic planning in which a rational intelligent agent plans its actions for encouraging a human to proceed in a social virtual reality (VR) environment. In order to persuade the human user to execute specific actions, the agent adapts the virtual environment by adjusting motivators in the environment. The agent's model of the human is based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), a cognitive theory to explain and predict human behavior. The intelligent agent manipulates the environment, a process where the agent conducts epistemic actions, i.e., adapting the environment and observing human responses, in order to understand the human's behavior and encourage human actions. An action reasoning framework is introduced that defines transitions between goal-oriented human activities in the virtual scenario. The proposed human-aware planning architecture can also be applied in environments that are not virtual, by utilizing modern mobile devices which have built-in sensors that measure motion, orientation, and various environmental conditions.
